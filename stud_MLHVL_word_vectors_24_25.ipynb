        "## Background\n",
        "Representing words as dense vectors over a finite-dimensional space was one of the recent breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing. Vectorial representations allow space-efficient, informationally rich storage of words that adequately captures their semantic content and enables numerical computation on them. Word vectors are the standard input representation for machine learning architectures for language processing. Even though new methods for constructing such representations emerge frequently, the original set of published papers remain a de facto point of reference as well as a good starting point. For this assignment, you will be asked to implement a small-scale variant of one such paper, namely [Global Word Vectors for Word Representation](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf) (\"the GloVe paper\").\n",
        "\n",
        "Notes on the paper will appear throughout the notebook to guide you along the code. It is, however, important to read and understand the paper, its terminology and the theory behind it before attempting to go through with the assignment. Some of the tasks will also require addressing the paper directly.\n",

        "There are 2 types of tasks in this assignment:\n",
        "- coding tasks --- asking you to write code following specifications provided; Most of the tasks come with test cases for sanity-check. Still, if something is not clear, <ins>do ask questions to lab teachers</ins>. When working with tensors, you have to use tensor-related operations instead of, e.g., inefficiently looping through tensor rows and columns.\n",
        "- interpretation questions --- asking you to interpret the data or the results of the model\n",
        "\n",
        "Each comes with its predefined points (totaling to 50pt). Some coding tasks have 0 points but solving them will be useful for you.\n",

        "* Don't clear the output of your code cells.\n",
        "* Don't output unnecessary info (e.g., printing variables for debugging purposes). This clutters the notebook and slows down the grading. You can have print() in the code, but comment them out before submitting the notebook.\n",

The high cosine similarites of spell name parts make sense, since spell name parts are related to each other such as 'avada kedavra' or 'expecto patronum'. Also, Hagrid in film series looks like a giant, so 'giant' and 'hagrid' word pairs has high similarity. On the other hand, when we tried other word pairs like 'bird' and 'owl', the similarity rate of 'bird' and 'owl' were lower than we expected. This could have been due to harry potter's word corpus, it resulted in low similarity scores that should normally been higher than 0.15 per our preconceived word understaning. Especially 'blade' and 'sword' word pair, we got 0 cosine similarity, but this word pair should have a similarity which shows word corpus of harry potter is not enough to perceive some word pairs similarities. This one makes more sense since HP does not contain any significant sword play which resulted in these words beeing out of distribution.   "

Especially, the words letter and its results  ['envelope', 'cage', 'paper', 'owl', 'hedwig', 'writing'] is a great example of this method resulting in in encapsulation of similarities in the vector space. This word results in a lot of related words as well however the word with highest score is literally a synonym of the input word.  However, other words such as quidditch result in related words instead of similar words. This could be due to quidditch not having a similar word in the HP books.
